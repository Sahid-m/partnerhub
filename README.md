# PartnerHub: Find Your Perfect Coding Partner

## Why Use PartnerHub?

As someone who has participated in various hackathons, I often struggled to find reliable teammates. Some had little to no real coding skills, while others would leave at the last second, even after claiming they knew what they were doing. This platform is designed to solve these problems by providing **proof of work** through GitHub integration. You can view a potential partnerâ€™s actual contributions, ensuring that they are the right fit for your team.
